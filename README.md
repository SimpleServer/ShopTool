Description
-----------
ShopTool is a tool for [SimpleServer](https://github.com/SimpleServer/SimpleServer)
to create Minecraft in-game shops based on SimpleServer *Events*.
In fact the user in the first step creates *pricelists* based on existing,
e.g. the *BasePriceList* pricelists, to be able to create shops from these
lists in the second step.
